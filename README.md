# Welcome! Character Counting

## Task
This program calculates the frequency of each character in a given string and displays the result.

## Description
This program takes a string as input and counts the occurrences of each character in that string. It then prints out each character along with its frequency.

## Installation
To compile the program, simply run the following command:

```bash
gcc -o character_count character_count.c
```

## Usage
After compiling the program, you can run it from the command line. Provide the string as a command-line argument.

```bash
./character_count "your_string_here"
```

Replace `"your_string_here"` with the string you want to analyze. For example:

```bash
./character_count "aassddff"
```

This will output the frequency of each character in the given string.
